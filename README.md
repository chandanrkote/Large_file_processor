# Large_file_processor
System which to handle long running processes in distributed systems.

# Deliverables: -
----------------
# 1. Steps to run your code. As less steps we are to run, better for you 
    To run this code: -
    1. Need to have SSMS and Anaconda
    2. Anacodea: - I Jupyter note book to write the python code.
    3. SSMS:- To check how data is inserting basically to test the workflow.
    
    
# 2. Details of all the tables and their schema, [with commands to recreate them]
   
   Initially I have created Database called PRODUCT which do not have any tables.

   Next I created python notebook called Large file processor_Assignment  
    1. Created Class as we need achieve OOPS concept
    2. The init method used to connect to the Server and database. Here I am passing Sever name and Database name as Parameter
    3. Other functions like create_table, drop_table, bulk_insert, update_by_sku functions also created to achieve the goal
    4. Everything explained in code itself, please refer:)

   
5. What is done from “Points to achieve” and number of entries in all your tables with sample 10 rows from each
6. What is not done from “Points to achieve”. If not achieved write the possible reasons and current workarounds.
7. What would you improve if given more days
