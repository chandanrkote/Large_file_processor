# 1. Steps to run your code. As less steps we are to run, better for you 
    To run this code: -
    1. Need to have SSMS and Anaconda
    2. Anacodea: - I Jupyter note book to write the python code.
    3. SSMS:- To check how data is inserting basically to test the workflow.
    
    
3. Details of all the tables and their schema, [with commands to recreate them]

5. What is done from “Points to achieve” and number of entries in all your tables with sample 10 rows from each
6. What is not done from “Points to achieve”. If not achieved write the possible reasons and current workarounds.
7. What would you improve if given more days
